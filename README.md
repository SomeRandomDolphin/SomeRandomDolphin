## Hello there!

I am Pradipta Arya Daniswara. I am a passionate self-taught independent developer looking to create whatever I desire and learning new things!

I know C++, C#, PHP, Java, and Javascript. But out of those five, I would say Javascript (specifically with Node) is my favourite to play around with and the one I am most comfortable with!

### Current Status

✍️ Learning Phyton and continuing to improve on mainly C++ and Javascript.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories. All of them are private currently, but i plan to make them open source someday!

💻 Studying in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.
